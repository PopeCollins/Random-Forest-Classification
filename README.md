# Random-Forest-Classification

Using forest of decision trees to get the classification of the penguins' birds species.  

Using the forest of decision trees in getting the species of penguins. The data set used is gotting from seaborn library "Penguis" data. Using the three different island  which are Biscoe,	Dream,	Torgersen. The species of the penguins bird was discovcered by the decision nodes which are body mass, and flipper length. These decision serve as the basis for the classification of the species of the bird. 



## Conclusion
Increasing the number of decions tree we got a higher test accuracy of the trianing data set. Also, a better precision of the training data. Using 5 and 7 decision tree in the both test it giving a test accuracy of 96% and 99% respectively. Which show our random selection of the decions tree gives the actual species of the penguins selected from diffrent island.
